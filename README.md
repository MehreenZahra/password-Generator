### Project Description

This project is a robust password generator built using React and styled with Tailwind CSS. It utilizes modern React features such as `useEffect`, `useState`, `useRef`, and `useCallback` hooks to efficiently manage state, handle side effects, and optimize performance.

The password generator allows users to customize various parameters such as password length and character types (uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols). Upon user input, it dynamically generates a secure password meeting the specified criteria. The interface is designed to be intuitive and responsive, thanks to Tailwind CSS, which provides a sleek and adaptable styling framework.
